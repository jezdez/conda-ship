# Environment Variables

This page lists environment variables used by conda-ship and generated
runtimes.

## Builder Variables

`CONDA_SHIP_TEMPLATE`
: Path to a prebuilt generic runtime template. `cs build` uses this when
  `--template` is not supplied and no installed template is found next to `cs`.

`CONDA_SHIP_EXECUTABLE`
: Path used by the Python `conda ship` adapter to find the `cs` executable.
  This is mainly useful for source checkouts, tests, and custom packaging. If
  set, it must point to an executable file. The adapter does not fall back to
  another `cs` when this value is invalid.

`CONDA_SHIP_ERROR_FORMAT`
: Internal diagnostic format used by the Python `conda ship` adapter. When set
  to `json`, `cs` writes a single structured JSON diagnostic line for builder
  failures. The adapter parses that line and renders a normal conda-facing
  error. Users normally do not need to set this themselves.

## Runtime Variables

`CONDA_SHIP_PREFIX`
: Universal managed-prefix override. It takes precedence over a
  runtime-specific prefix variable. Use this for a runtime named `conda`
  because that runtime does not treat `CONDA_PREFIX` as an install override.
  `CONDA_PREFIX` can describe an activated conda environment and must not
  redirect the runtime bootstrap.

The remaining runtime variable names are derived from `runtime-name`.
Non-alphanumeric characters become underscores and letters are uppercased.

`RUNTIME_PREFIX`
: Override the managed prefix path. For a runtime named `demo`, the variable is
  `DEMO_PREFIX`. This compatibility variable is accepted for runtime names
  other than `conda`. `CONDA_SHIP_PREFIX` takes precedence when both are set.

`RUNTIME_BUNDLE`
: Runtime-specific path to an external package bundle directory. The actual
  variable name is based on the runtime name. Non-alphanumeric characters become
  underscores and letters are uppercased. For `demo`, the variable is
  `DEMO_BUNDLE`.

`RUNTIME_OFFLINE`
: Runtime-specific flag for offline bootstrap mode. For `demo`, the variable is
  `DEMO_OFFLINE`. Empty, `0`, and `false` disable the flag. Other non-empty
  values enable it.

## Runtime Update Coordinator Variables

These variables define the version-one child-process contract for downstream
transaction coordinators. They are not normal user-facing runtime controls.
See {doc}`runtime-cli` for the required bootstrap, lock, and call sequence.

`CONDA_SHIP_INTERNAL_UPDATE`
: Select the helper action. Version one defines `v1/record-installation`,
  `v1/check`, `v1/stage`, and `v1/apply`. Generated runtimes do not reserve a
  delegate subcommand for these operations.

`CONDA_SHIP_INTERNAL_UPDATE_CANDIDATE`
: Lowercase SHA256 selected from the `v1/check` result. It is required by
  `v1/stage` and is ignored by the other actions.

`CONDA_SHIP_INTERNAL_UPDATE_OFFLINE`
: Disable network access for update resolution and staging. Empty, `0`, and
  `false` disable the flag. Other non-empty values enable it. An HTTPS update
  requires previously cached repodata and package content in this mode. A
  `file://` channel is read directly.

`CONDA_SHIP_INTERNAL_UPDATE_OWNERSHIP`
: Installed executable ownership for `v1/record-installation`. Supported values
  are `direct` and `external`.

`CONDA_SHIP_INTERNAL_UPDATE_INSTALLATION`
: Lowercase installation identifier for `v1/record-installation`, such as
  `standalone`, `constructor`, `homebrew`, `pipx`, or `uv-tool`.

`CONDA_SHIP_INTERNAL_UPDATE_EXECUTABLE`
: Optional absolute stable executable path for `v1/record-installation`. The
  path must resolve to the running executable. When omitted, the runtime uses
  its invocation path.

`CONDA_SHIP_INTERNAL_UPDATE_INSTRUCTION`
: Optional non-empty external-manager instruction for
  `v1/record-installation`. Direct ownership rejects this variable.

## Delegate Environment

The runtime executes the configured delegate from the managed prefix without
presenting that prefix as an activated conda environment. It does not set
`CONDA_PREFIX`, `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV`, or `CONDA_SHLVL`. Delegate arguments and
the inherited process streams remain unchanged.

`PATH`
: Managed-prefix executable directories are prepended to the inherited value so
  the delegate and its child processes can find installed commands and shared
  libraries. This changes `PATH` only. It does not activate the prefix.

## Test And Development Variable

`CONDA_SHIP_ALLOW_UNSTAMPED_TEMPLATE`
: Allows the generic runtime template binary to run without stamped runtime
  data. This is used by tests. Downstream runtimes should not set it.

```{warning}
Do not set `CONDA_SHIP_ALLOW_UNSTAMPED_TEMPLATE` in distribution builds or user
environments. It exists only so tests can exercise the generic template binary.
```
