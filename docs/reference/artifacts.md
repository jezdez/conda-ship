# Artifact Reference

Every `cs build` writes a runtime plus metadata files. The runtime
is the final stamped binary artifact. Downstream signing and attestation
workflows run after conda-ship writes these files.

## conda-ship Release Assets

Tagged conda-ship releases publish the builder assets that the GitHub Action
downloads:

`cs-<target>`
: Builder CLI for the target platform.

`cs-template-<target>`
: Generic runtime template for the target platform.

`SHA256SUMS`
: Checksums for release assets.

The PyPI release for the same tag publishes platform wheels that install `cs`
and `cs-template` into the Python environment's scripts directory, plus a
source distribution for packaging systems. Published release assets are
immutable. Fixes use a new tag rather than replacing files under an existing
tag.

## Layouts

| Layout | Runtime | Bundle file | Network during bootstrap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `online` | `RUNTIME` | none | yes |
| `external` | `RUNTIME` | `RUNTIME.bundle.tar.zst` | optional |
| `embedded` | `RUNTIME` | embedded in binary | no |

When `[tool.conda-ship].artifact-name` or `--artifact-name` is set, all layouts use
that value for the staged runtime and metadata stem. On Windows, binary
filenames also include `.exe`.

For the difference between `runtime-name` and `artifact-name`, see
{doc}`names`.

## Runtime Update Packages

`cs package-update` writes a dependency-free native `.conda` package from a
finalized update-enabled `online` or `embedded` runtime. This is separate from
`cs build` and does not add a file to the normal `dist/` set unless that
directory is selected explicitly.

The package contains one executable payload plus normal conda package metadata:

- `bin/ARTIFACT_NAME` on Unix
- `ARTIFACT_NAME.exe` on Windows

The package name, version, build number, and platform come from the executable
stamp and its artifact info JSON. The package has no runtime dependencies. It
is transport for the executable update engine and is not installed into the
managed prefix.

The command refuses to overwrite an existing output. Its `--json` result
reports SHA256 and size values for both the package and finalized executable
payload. Channel indexing and upload remain downstream release operations.

## Bundle Contents

Bundles are a transport for the conda package archives already named in the
runtime lock. They are not channel mirrors and do not use a `linux-64/` or
`noarch/` directory layout.

`external` and `embedded` bundles contain top-level `.conda` and `.tar.bz2`
package archive files. The runtime matches those filenames against the stamped
lockfile and verifies package SHA256 values before installing from them.

External bundle directories may contain unrelated files, but conda-ship only
indexes top-level conda package archives and skips symbolic links. Embedded
bundles are stricter because they are extracted from a tar archive: every entry
must be a top-level regular `.conda` or `.tar.bz2` file. Directory entries,
nested paths, symbolic links, hard links, and other file types are rejected.

## Metadata Files

For an `online` build with runtime `demo`, conda-ship stages:

- `demo` or `demo.exe`
- `demo.runtime.lock`
- `demo.packages.txt`
- `demo.cdx.json`
- `demo.info.json`
- `demo.sha256`

When `--target-label` is used, the label is inserted into the stem, for example
`demo-linux-64.info.json`.

If `artifact-name = "demo-cli"` or `--artifact-name demo-cli` is set, the artifact
stem uses that explicit name for any layout, for example `demo-cli.info.json`
or `demo-cli-linux-64.info.json`.

For an `external` build, conda-ship also stages `demo.bundle.tar.zst` or a
target-qualified equivalent.

These files describe the staged release output. During automatic first-run
bootstrap, the generated runtime also writes managed-prefix metadata such as
`conda-meta/history` and `conda-meta/initial-state.explicit.txt` inside the
install path.

## CycloneDX SBOM

Every staged build writes a CycloneDX 1.7 JSON SBOM named
`ARTIFACT.cdx.json`. The document identifies the staged runtime as the root
application and includes every conda package for the target platform in the
derived runtime lock. Package components include the exact version, build,
subdir, channel, filename, download URL, SHA256 and MD5 hashes, and license
value when those fields are available. Direct dependency edges come from the
solved package records. Dependency sets containing conditional or unparseable
MatchSpecs are marked `unknown` rather than inventing relationships that the
runtime lock cannot prove.

Channel and remote download URLs are sanitized before they are written. URL
credentials, Anaconda `/t/<token>` path segments, queries, and fragments are
removed. Local paths and `file:` URLs are omitted.

This mapping uses existing conda contracts for
[package identifiers](https://conda.org/learn/ceps/cep-0026/),
[MatchSpecs](https://conda.org/learn/ceps/cep-0029/),
[package metadata](https://conda.org/learn/ceps/cep-0034/), and
[repodata records](https://conda.org/learn/ceps/cep-0036/). No accepted conda
CEP currently defines an environment SBOM format or CRA profile.

The derived runtime lock does not currently retain the original requested
MatchSpecs. The root component therefore points to graph roots inferred from
the resolved package edges, plus a representative of any otherwise unreachable
dependency cycle. Every resolved package remains present even when that
inference cannot reproduce the user's declared top-level set.

When a package record names a dependency that is absent from the target
platform's resolved package set, the SBOM records the number of omitted edges
on the root and marks the affected package dependency sets as incomplete. It
does not invent a component without an exact package record.

For a product that falls within the EU
[Cyber Resilience Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/2024-11-20/eng),
this file can provide the resolved conda environment portion of its technical
documentation. The CRA requires a commonly used, machine-readable SBOM that
covers at least top-level dependencies. It does not mandate CycloneDX 1.7.
conda-ship chooses the
[CycloneDX 1.7 JSON schema](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.7/json/) and records the
resolved target-platform package graph to the extent that package records
permit.

The SBOM composition is deliberately marked `incomplete`. Conda package
records do not describe every operating-system component or every dependency
vendored or statically linked into a package. Rust crates linked into
`cs-template` are also outside the resolved conda graph. The broader package
metadata gap is discussed in
[conda/ceps#127](https://github.com/conda/ceps/issues/127). The generated file is
therefore a CRA-oriented inventory of the resolved conda environment, not proof
of complete product coverage or legal conformity.

Conda package PURLs follow the current
[package-url conda type](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/main/docs/types/definitions/conda-definition.md).
They are package-url identifiers, not an accepted conda CEP contract. License
values are kept as named licenses because historical repodata does not
guarantee a valid SPDX expression.

conda-ship does not infer an SBOM author or product manufacturer from a channel
or package record. Compliance profiles that require author, manufacturer, or
contact metadata are outside the current output contract. Do not edit the
staged SBOM in place because its checksum is recorded in `.info.json` and
`.sha256`.

`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` controls the SBOM timestamp when set. Otherwise the build
time is recorded in UTC. Rebuild the SBOM whenever the runtime or package set
changes.

## Stamped Runtime Data

conda-ship appends a runtime data block to every staged runtime. The block
contains the runtime lock, runtime and artifact identity, version, platform,
delegate executable, install scheme, install name, docs URL, installer,
optional executable update configuration, bundle and offline environment
variable names, and the embedded bundle bytes for `embedded` builds. The
universal `CONDA_SHIP_PREFIX` override is runtime behavior rather than a
stamped variable name.

The data block ends with:

- format version
- header length
- bundle length
- header SHA256
- bundle SHA256, or the SHA256 of empty bytes when no embedded bundle is present
- conda-ship runtime-data magic bytes

The generated runtime validates the stamped header at startup. For
embedded artifacts, it also verifies the bundle checksum before extracting package
archives during automatic bootstrap.

The binary checksum in `.sha256` covers the final stamped artifact. The
conda-ship release workflow also publishes GitHub Artifact Attestations for
the `cs` CLI, runtime templates, and `SHA256SUMS` manifest.

If signing or another downstream step changes the staged executable, the
original `.sha256` continues to describe the `cs build` output. Pass the
finalized file to `cs package-update --binary`. The command snapshots those
bytes and reports the finalized payload digest in its JSON output.

Verify a downloaded release asset with:

```bash
gh attestation verify ./cs-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \
  -R jezdez/conda-ship \
  --signer-workflow jezdez/conda-ship/.github/workflows/release.yml
```

Downstream distributions can add their own attestations or platform signing
after conda-ship finishes staging their runtime artifacts.
