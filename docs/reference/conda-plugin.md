# `conda ship` Reference

Most users run conda-ship as `cs`.

When `conda-ship` is installed in a conda environment, it can also add a
`conda ship` command. This is only a conda-style shortcut for the same
builder:

```bash
conda ship inspect
conda ship build
```

`conda ship ...` runs the installed `cs` executable with the same
arguments. It is not a separate builder and it does not make conda-ship part
of conda itself.

Packaged builds find the runtime template installed next to `cs`
automatically. Source checkouts need an installed template, a
`CONDA_SHIP_TEMPLATE` environment variable, or an explicit `--template` path.

## Packaging Details

The PyPI package installs the Python adapter and the Rust-built `cs` executable
together. `conda-ship` looks for `cs` next to the current Python interpreter.
It does not search `PATH`, so `conda ship` cannot accidentally run an unrelated
`cs` executable from another environment. A future conda package should use the
same layout.

Packages must install these pieces into the same environment:

- the Rust-built `cs` executable
- the Rust-built `cs-template` runtime template
- the Python `conda_ship` adapter package

For custom packaging or tests, set `CONDA_SHIP_EXECUTABLE` to an explicit
executable path. If that variable is set, it must point to a valid executable;
the adapter fails instead of falling back to the packaged `cs`.

## Argument Forwarding

Arguments after `conda ship` are passed to `cs`:

```bash
conda ship build --artifact-layout embedded
```

When you need to pass an argument that conda's own parser would consume, insert
`--` before the conda-ship arguments:

```bash
conda ship -- --help
```

Running `conda ship` without arguments shows `cs --help`.

## Project Metadata Versions

When `[tool.conda-ship]` contains
`runtime-version = { from = "project-metadata" }`, the Python adapter resolves
the version before invoking `cs build` or `cs run`. It calls the project's PEP
517 `prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel` hook, reads `Version` from the generated
wheel metadata, and forwards the concrete value as `--runtime-version`.

Direct `cs build` invocations do not run Python packaging hooks. Use
`conda ship build` for this source, or pass `cs build --runtime-version VERSION`.

## Error Handling

`conda ship` asks `cs` for structured builder diagnostics and translates them
back into regular command-line errors. That keeps common failures predictable
for the conda plugin while preserving the richer terminal output for direct
`cs` use.

For example, when a source lockfile is missing, `cs` reports a stable diagnostic
kind to the adapter, and `conda ship` shows the message and hint without
printing raw JSON.
