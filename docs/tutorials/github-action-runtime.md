# Build A Runtime In GitHub Actions

This tutorial takes a committed conda-ship project and builds runtime artifacts
with the composite GitHub Action.

You will add a workflow that downloads released conda-ship build tools, verifies
them, runs `cs build --dry-run`, builds the runtime, and uploads the generated
`dist` directory as a workflow artifact.

## Before You Start

You need a repository that already contains one supported manifest and lockfile
pair:

- `conda.toml` and `conda.lock`
- `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock`
- `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.conda]` and `conda.lock`
- `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.pixi]` and `pixi.lock`

The manifest must contain `[tool.conda-ship]` with at least:

```toml
[tool.conda-ship]
runtime-name = "demo"
runtime-version = "0.1.0"
delegate-executable = "conda"
source-environment = "ship"
```

Run the local preflight before committing:

```bash
cs inspect
cs build --dry-run
```

## Add The Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/build-runtime.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build runtime

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
  attestations: write
  artifact-metadata: write

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build ${{ matrix.os }} ${{ matrix.layout }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            layout: online
            installer: standalone
          - os: macos-15-intel
            layout: embedded
            installer: homebrew
          - os: macos-15
            layout: embedded
            installer: homebrew
          - os: windows-latest
            layout: online
            installer: standalone

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: jezdez/conda-ship@FULL_RELEASE_COMMIT_SHA # X.Y.Z
        id: cs
        with:
          conda-ship-version: "X.Y.Z"
          artifact-layout: ${{ matrix.layout }}
          installer: ${{ matrix.installer }}

      - uses: actions/attest@59d89421af93a897026c735860bf21b6eb4f7b26 # v4.1.0
        with:
          subject-path: ${{ steps.cs.outputs.dist-path }}/*

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ${{ steps.cs.outputs.asset-name }}
          path: ${{ steps.cs.outputs.dist-path }}
```

Pin the action source to a full conda-ship release commit SHA and pass the
matching conda-ship release through `conda-ship-version`.

```{warning}
Use the latest reviewed `actions/attest` release in your workflow and pin it by
commit SHA. The SHA above is an example, not a recommendation to keep using that
exact revision indefinitely.
```

## Run It

Push the workflow and start it from the GitHub Actions tab, or wait for the next
push to `main`.

The action downloads these release assets for the current runner:

- `cs-<target>`
- `cs-template-<target>`
- `SHA256SUMS`

It verifies GitHub artifact attestations and the checksums before running the
downloaded `cs` binary.

The workflow also attests the generated runtime output directory before
uploading it. That downstream attestation covers the runtime binary,
`.runtime.lock`, `.packages.txt`, `.info.json`, `.sha256`, and any external
bundle produced by that job.

## Inspect The Artifact

Each job uploads the full generated output directory. Download one artifact and
inspect the files:

```text
demo-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
demo-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.info.json
demo-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.packages.txt
demo-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.runtime.lock
demo-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.sha256
```

For an `external` build, the directory also contains
`demo-<target>.bundle.tar.zst`. For an `embedded` build, the runtime carries
the bundle inside the binary and uses the configured runtime name unless
`artifact-name` sets a distinct artifact name.

## Override Runtime Metadata

Keep package and channel choices in the manifest and lockfile. Use action inputs
for release-job metadata that may vary across a matrix:

```yaml
- uses: jezdez/conda-ship@FULL_RELEASE_COMMIT_SHA # X.Y.Z
  id: cs
  with:
    conda-ship-version: "X.Y.Z"
    runtime-name: demo
    delegate-executable: conda
    artifact-layout: ${{ matrix.layout }}
    docs-url: https://example.com/demo/
    install-scheme: conda-home
    install-name: demo
    installer: ${{ matrix.installer }}
```

The action does not validate those values itself. It passes them to
`cs build --dry-run`; invalid values fail in conda-ship before artifact files
are written.

## What You Learned

You added a release-style workflow that builds conda-ship runtime artifacts from
committed project input. The solve still belongs to conda-workspaces or Pixi;
the action consumes the committed lockfile and stamps a runtime with
release-specific metadata.
